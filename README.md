## Adaptation for TUGraz DMP Tool

This project is based on the DAMAP backend developed in cooperation between TU Wien and TU Graz, but has been adapted to meet the specific needs of the TUGraz DMP Tool. This adaptation focuses on institutional integration, allowing researchers to manage their Data Management Plans (DMPs) efficiently, leveraging existing systems at the institution.

## Installation

DAMAP can be deployed using several methods. The recommended approach is running DAMAP as containers. Detailed installation instructions can be found in the [INSTALLATION.md](INSTALLATION.md) file.

## Customisation

For institutional integration, customisation details are available in the [CUSTOMISING.md](CUSTOMISING.md) file.
